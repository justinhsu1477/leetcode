# LeetCode Practice

This repository is used for practicing LeetCode problems in Java.

## How Claude Can Help

- **Read a problem**: Paste a LeetCode problem title or URL, I'll explain the problem and suggest approaches.
- **Discuss solutions**: I can walk through brute-force to optimal solutions with time/space complexity analysis.
- **Write solution code**: I'll write Java solutions in `src/main/java/leetcode/` following the naming convention `Solution_{number}_{ProblemName}.java`.
- **Explain algorithms**: Ask me about any data structure or algorithm concept (DP, sliding window, monotonic stack, etc.).
- **Review your code**: Paste your solution and I'll review correctness, edge cases, and optimization opportunities.
- **Run tests**: I can compile and run your solutions with test cases.
- **Compare approaches**: I can show multiple solutions for the same problem and compare trade-offs.

## Prompts You Can Try

- "Help me solve LeetCode #1 Two Sum"
- "Explain the approach for this problem: [paste problem]"
- "Review my solution for [problem]"
- "What pattern does this problem use?"
- "Give me similar problems to practice [topic]"
